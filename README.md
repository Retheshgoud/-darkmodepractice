# -darkmodepractice
As dark mode has gained a lot of traction recently, here's one of the darkmode approaches in JS using the LocalStorage :point_down:
<br>
<br>
:point_right: Firstly,Youâ€™ll need to include an onclick method on your input to run the code to toggle the light/dark background.
<br>
<br>
:point_right: Then, set up my main class to cover the entire viewport width and height and added flex styling to center the toggle button and text.
<br>
<br>
:point_right: styling for the toggle button done
<br>
<br>
:point_right: Then create the code for the darkLight() onClick event. I created an if/else statement to toggle the dark class and save it to the local storage.
<br>
<br>
:point_right: Now we have the code to toggle a dark/light background, and when the user refreshes the browser, the background color will be saved to their local storage.:+1:
